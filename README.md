## ⚠️ The Golden Rule

NEVER commit directly to the main branch.
Always create a new branch for your changes.

## 🚀 How to Run the App

We have included a graphical interface (main.py) to test your code.

1. Open VS Code.
2. Open the terminal (Ctrl + ).
3. Run the app:

```
python main.py
```


4. Try clicking the buttons. If a function (like "Multiply") hasn't been written yet, the app will tell you!

## 📋 Your Assignment

Your goal is to add a mathematical function to calculator.py without breaking your teammates' code.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repo**

    - Open VS Code.

    - Press F1 -> Git: Clone.

    - Paste the URL of this repo.

2. **Create Your Branch**

    - Click main in the bottom-left corner.

    - Select + Create new branch.

    -  Name it: feature/yourname-operation (e.g., feature/alex-multiply).

3. **Write Code**

    - Open calculator.py.

    - Add your assigned function (subtract, multiply, divide, modulo).

    - Do not delete the existing add function!

4. **Save & Push**

    - Go to the Source Control tab (the "Y" icon).

    -  Stage your changes (+).

    - Commit with a message: "Add multiplication function".

    - Click Publish Branch (Cloud icon).

5. **Pull Request**

    - Go to this repo on GitHub.

    - Click Compare & pull request on the yellow banner.

    - Create the PR and assign your Team Lead to review it.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **Merge Conflict?** Don't panic. Click "Accept Incoming" or "Accept Current" in VS Code to decide which code stays.

- **Detached Head?** You are lost in time. Create a new branch immediately to save your spot.
